SURFQuantum is the offical git repository of ![SURF](https://www.surf.nl/)'s quantum team. Here we share our code about all things quantum: quantum computing, quantum internet but also workshops, tutorials and useful software tools.
## Our Mission

[Your mission statement]

## Projects

Here are some of our active projects:

1. [Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms](https://github.com/SURFQuantum/qc-quantum-linear-systems): Full workflow for solving linear systems of equations with quantum algorithms such as HHL or VQLS.
2. [YOTSE - Your Optimization Tool for Scientific Experiments](https://github.com/SURFQuantum/yotse): YOTSE is a powerful tool designed to enable computational experiments using any software, offering a set of predefined functions for performing parameter explorations and optimizations in a scalable and efficient manner.
