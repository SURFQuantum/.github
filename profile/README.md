SURFQuantum is the offical git repository of [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/)'s quantum team. Here we share our code about all things quantum: quantum computing, quantum internet but also workshops, tutorials and useful software tools.

For more information about our team check out:
- [SURF Quantum Computing](https://www.surf.nl/quantum-computing)
- [SURF Quantum Internet](https://www.surf.nl/quantum-internet)

## Our Mission
- Support access and use of quantum simulators as well as physical quantum computers
- Understand the required expertise and tools to transform regular applications into quantum applications
- Stimulate and support the development of quantum applications
- Understand the applicability for scientific applications
- Support Dutch research to take early and competitive advantage of quantum technologies

## Projects

Here are some of our active projects:

1. [Qubit Routing with Reinforcement Learning (RL)](https://github.com/SURFQuantum/qc-quantum-routing-optimization): Qubit routing procedure that makes use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model.
2. [Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms](https://github.com/SURFQuantum/qc-quantum-linear-systems): Full workflow for solving linear systems of equations with quantum algorithms such as HHL or VQLS.
3. [Medical Imaging](https://github.com/SURFQuantum/qc-medical-imaging): Medical Imaging with Machine Learning and Quantum Machine Learning.
4. [YOTSE - Your Optimization Tool for Scientific Experiments](https://github.com/SURFQuantum/yotse): YOTSE is a powerful tool designed to enable computational experiments using any software, offering a set of predefined functions for performing parameter explorations and optimizations in a scalable and efficient manner.

## Repository Structure

The repositories in this organization are named with prefixes to group repositories thematically as `<prefix>-<repo_name>`.
- `qc-` Quantum Computing
- `qn-` Quantum Networks/Internet
- `edu-` education/trainings/workshops
  
Standalone software packages don't need prefixes.
